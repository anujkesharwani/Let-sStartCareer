	<h2>Career Options After 11th</h2>
      <p>Choosing what to study after class 11th is a critical 
      and career-defining decision. Unfortunately, too many students begin career
      planning at the last minute and end up choosing paths that are popular, but 
      not suited to their aptitudes. Therefore, it is important to begin early and to
      know what options lay ahead of you after school so that you can make an intelligent
      and calculated decision. Students often miss out on potentially great career choices
      due to lack of timely information.</p>
