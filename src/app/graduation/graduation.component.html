<h3>Tips To Get Your Career Started After Graduation</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you pick a career option that best suits your goals:</p>

<p>Meet with your college's career advisor. Most colleges have free resources such as placement cells or a career office where you can avail career counselling if you are unsure about your career path or would like to gain a better understanding of your career options. Depending on the reputation of your college, you may also join an alumni networking program to meet with professionals to discuss your career plans.</p>
<p>Start networking. Networking within the community is a great way to find niche career options. Staying in touch with your college's alumni association, going to professional networking fairs and staying active on job networking sites to give you a better chance at a satisfying career.</p>
<p>Enroll for short-term professional specialisation courses. Before committing to post-graduate or diploma courses in specialised subjects to advance on your career path, consider signing up for six or nine month courses in these subjects. This may allow you to get a better idea whether a certain area is suitable for you to pick as a career option.</p>
<p>Pursue internships. Many jobs in fields such as digital marketing do not necessarily require you to have a professional degree in the field. You may opt to do internships to gain knowledge and experience, and to enhance your skills.</p>
